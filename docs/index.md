# Artemis (ARX)

**ARX** is a compiled programming language designed to be minimal, expressive, and powerful. It draws inspiration from Python and Lua while providing low-level control through LLVM and native C interoperability.

ARX is built for both **performance** and **clarity**, allowing developers to write clean code without sacrificing native execution power.

## Hello World Example

```arx
using io

int _exec() {
    io.print('Hello World!')
    return 0
}
```
